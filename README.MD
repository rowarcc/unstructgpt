Simple project that will parse unstructured data to a structured data using chatGPT 3.5

the quality of parser will be depended on the performance of chatGPT 3.5, you may use chatGPT 4.0 if you have API key for that
the quality of parser may also be improved with a better tuned GPT3.5 prompt, which you can edit in gpt35persona.txt

to get a estimate of the cost of this call using chatGPT API, you may utilize get_embedding function in embedding.py
