Friendly Captcha | Software Engineer (Full-stack) | REMOTE (domiciled within EU only) | PART-TIME or FULL-TIME | Office in Munich, Germany | https://friendlycaptcha.com
At Friendly Captcha we do one thing and we do it well: we protect websites from malicious actors and bots. We provide privacy-friendly and accessible anti-bot solutions that don’t annoy users with tasks like clicking fire hydrants.
We’re a fast-growing, profitable company. Our revenue mostly comes from medium to large European enterprise and governments.
A great fit would be someone who can contribute across the entire stack, and prefers to keep things simple (perhaps boring is the right word even?). Good knowledge of the web and browser APIs is definitely useful in this role. At our scale we are looking for generalists more than specialists - it's inevitable you will be wearing different hats.
Our engineering team is fully remote across Europe, we meet up once per quarter or so. You can work either 4 or 5 days per week, fully remote or from our Munich office.
Stack: Golang | Typescript | Clickhouse | Postgres | Redis | Python ML/data science stack
